# Employee Attrition Power-BI Dashboard



## Overview 
This project aims to develop a Power BI Dashboard to comprehend employee attrition and explore the factors contributing to turnover, facilitating the development of effective retention strategies. The goal is to enhance retention and strengthen the workforce through actionable insights presented in the dashboard.

## Features
The Employee Attrition Dashboard includes the following features:

- **Attrition Overview:** Provides an overview of attrition statistics, including attrition rate, total employees, and attrition trends over time.
- **Employee Demographics:** Visualizes the distribution of employees by demographics, such as age, gender, and department, to identify patterns related to attrition.
- **Attrition Analysis:** Analyzes attrition based on various factors, such as job level and education to understand their impact on employee turnover.
- **Retention Strategies:** Offers insights into potential retention strategies by identifying factors associated with higher attrition rates, such as low salary or lack of growth opportunities.

## Steps
**1.Setting Objectives:**

- Clarified scope and objectives, aiming to gain insights into employee attrition patterns.

**2.Data Collection and Exploration:**

- Gathered HR attrition dataset from Kaggle.
Analyzed the dataset to gain insights into employee demographics, job attributes, performance ratings, and attrition status. This involved visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques.

**3.Metric Development:**

- Utilized Power BI Desktop and Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create key performance indicators (KPIs) such as attrition rate, department-wise turnover, etc.

**4.Dashboard Creation:**

- Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI Desktop to visualize the analysis results. The dashboard includes various visualizations, filters, and slicers to facilitate the exploration and understanding of employee attrition patterns.

## Insights
- Most attrition occurs during the first few years of employment.
- Younger workers have higher turnover compared to older workers.
- Employees with lower education have higher turnover.
- Employees who live further from the workplace have higher attrition.
- Employees in lower job levels have the highest attrition.
- Research and development department has the highest attrition.
- Laboratory technicians have the highest attrition.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights areas where targeted interventions can enhance employee retention. By addressing factors like work-life balance and compensation, implementing strategies to support employees in high-turnover roles, and fostering a supportive work environment, the company can reduce attrition rates and improve organizational stability. Proactive measures aligned with these insights can lead to a more engaged and committed workforce, ultimately contributing to long-term success.
